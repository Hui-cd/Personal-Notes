# Introduction to IT Project Management WEEK 1

## Why Do Organisations Undertake Projects?
Organisations undertake projects from different perspectives, which guide their goals and methodologies.

### The Enterprise-centric Perspective
Organisations initiate projects to develop or improve products and services that align with their business goals.

### The Lifecycle-centric Perspective
Projects are also started in response to external and internal threats and opportunities, guiding the strategic direction of the organisation.

## What is a Project?
A project is defined as a temporary endeavour undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result.

## Types of Projects
Projects can be categorized based on their necessity and strategic importance:
- Mandatory ("must do", e.g., compliance with legislation)
- Business-critical ("need to do", e.g., IT infrastructure upgrade)
- Stewardship ("have responsibility to do", e.g., natural habitat restoration)
- Discretionary ("can choose to do", e.g., product development)

## Project Management Models
Different models of project management cater to the varying complexity and requirements of projects.

## The Role of a Project Manager
The project manager plays a critical role within the performing organization by being directly responsible for achieving the project objectives.

- **Authority and Reporting:** The formal authority and the reporting lines of the project manager depend on the organizational structure.
- **Effectiveness Factors:**
    - **Knowledge:** Comprises both project management expertise and specific domain knowledge.
    - **Performance:** Reflects the application of knowledge to achieve project objectives.
    - **Behaviour:** How the project manager acts during the performance of project tasks.

## Projects, Programs and Portfolios

### What is a Portfolio?
A portfolio is a collection of projects, programs, and other work grouped together to facilitate effective management towards strategic business objectives.

- Contains initiatives aligned with business strategy, ranked and prioritized by quantifiable evaluation criteria such as business value, risk, benefits realization timeline, and resource requirements.
- Initiatives within the portfolio often compete for resources.
- Success is measured by specific business KPIs like revenue, profit, market share, and stock price.

### Portfolio Management
Portfolio Management ensures alignment with strategic goals, evaluates and selects initiatives, and allocates resources effectively.

- **Key Artefact:** Business Case supporting decision-making at the portfolio level.

### What is a Programme?
A programme is a group of related projects managed in a coordinated way to obtain benefits and control not available from managing them individually.

- Comprises multiple projects aligned with one or more business objectives.
- Involves overall coordination of planning and execution, considering scope, budget, schedule, quality, resourcing conflicts, and constraints.
- Includes risk evaluation and contingency planning.
- Provides a unified governance structure.
- Supports the transition of project outcomes into business benefits.

### Comparing project, programme, and portfolio

| Category        | Project                                                 | Programme                                              | Portfolio                                              |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Schedule        | Project schedule is the time taken to create the deliverables expected out of the project. | Program schedule is essentially the aggregation of the schedule of the program components. | Portfolio does not have a schedule. Individual program/projects that facilitate achieving the business objectives will have their respective schedules. |
| Risk Management | Risks are typically considered as threats.               | Risks are considered as opportunities but sometimes as threats also. | Risks are considered as deviation from stakeholder expectations and managed through portfolio balance. |
| Monitoring and control | Project manager directly monitors and controls the activities and deliverables. | Program manager uses program governance mechanism for monitoring and control. | Portfolio manager monitors the aggregated performance and value indicators. |
| Leadership Style | Mainly execution oriented, Project manager is part of the team. | Program manager is the leader with the vision and aids in relationship and conflict management. | Portfolio managers provide leadership and add value to the portfolio decisions. |

### Program Management
Program Management ensures that projects within each program deliver business value aligned with strategic goals and focuses on Benefits Management, Stakeholder Management, and Program Governance.
