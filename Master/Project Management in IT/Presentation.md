First, we have developed a detailed Gantt chart that covers the entire project timeline. This schedule not only guides our daily work, but also ensures our on-time delivery at key nodes.

Firstly, using expert judgment is characterized by speed and resource efficiency. It is quick to deploy and requires minimal resources in terms of time and cost. Secondly, experts can flexibly apply their judgment to adapt to various situations and requirements. Expert judgment aids in understanding complex estimation scenarios that may not be easily quantifiable and incorporates nuanced insights that models might miss. Moreover, expert judgment leverages the tacit knowledge of seasoned professionals, which is often hard to document or quantify.

However, there are some drawbacks to expert judgment. The primary issue is subjectivity and bias, as expert opinions may be influenced by personal experiences, opinions, or even external pressures. Additionally, different experts might produce significantly different estimates based on the same information due to their personal methods and perspectives.

To mitigate schedule delays, we have implemented the following measures:

First, we monitor and identify delays. We regularly review the project progress, compare it with the scheduled plan, and promptly identify any time deviations. We use project management software or tools to track the completion of key milestones and activities in real-time.

Our mitigation strategies include resource reallocation: based on the urgent needs of the project, we adjust resource allocation to prioritize activities on the critical path. We increase working hours, such as working overtime or weekends, to accelerate the project. We adjust the project scope: we communicate with the customer to reduce or postpone the scope of non-critical functions. Risk management: we enhance the monitoring and preventive measures for potential risks to avoid further impact on the project schedule.

Through these methods, we hope to effectively manage and control project progress, ensuring the project's objectives are met on time.

首先这是我们的甘特图，它包含了整个项目的时间安排，我们采用的活动持续时间估计方法是利用经验丰富的项目规划者来进行整个项目的规划这种方法具有以下几点优势1. 

**专业知识**：经验丰富的规划者通常对项目管理和具体行业有深入了解。在行人轨迹预测项目中，这种专业知识可以帮助更准确地评估所需的技术和资源，从而提高项目成功的可能性。
    
2. **风险识别和管理**：这些规划者能够凭借经验识别潜在的风险点，例如技术挑战、预算超支或时间延误等，并提前制定应对策略。对于行人轨迹预测系统，如此能够及时处理数据隐私、算法准确性等问题。
    
3. **资源优化分配**：经验丰富的项目规划者更擅长资源调配，能够有效分配人力、物资、时间等资源，确保各个阶段的工作都能顺利进行。在技术密集型的项目如行人轨迹预测中，这一点尤为重要，因为技术开发、测试和部署等阶段都需要严格的资源管理。
    
7. **Utilizing Expertise**:    Experienced planners have a deep understanding of project management and this industries. In pedestrian trajectory prediction projects, this expertise helps us more accurately assess the required technology and resources, significantly enhancing the likelihood of project success.
    
2. **Risk Identification and Management**: Through our team's experience, we can proactively identify potential technical challenges and budget issues and develop effective strategies to address them. This includes a focused attention on data privacy and algorithm accuracy to ensure these issues do not hinder our progress.
    
3. **Optimization of Resource Allocation**: We will ensure that resources are most effectively allocated, especially manpower, materials, and time. We will focus on every phase of technology development, testing, and deployment to ensure that critical tasks are prioritized.
    
4. **Efficient Decision-Making**: When facing any challenges within the project, our team will make wise decisions swiftly. These decisions will be based on our extensive historical experience and accurate assessment of the current project status.
