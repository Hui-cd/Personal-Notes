# The Project Lifecycle WEEK 2

The project lifecycle is crucial in distinguishing projects from non-projects, due to their temporary nature. It provides a structured framework for managing projects through various phases.

## Definition of a Project Lifecycle

A project lifecycle is a collection of generally sequential and sometimes overlapping project phases, which collectively provide a framework for managing a project.

- **Distinctive Nature:** "The lifecycle is the only thing that uniquely distinguishes projects from non-projects."
- **Methodological Foundation:** The definition of the lifecycle, combined with the definitions of deliverables and the roles, responsibilities, and processes involved in their creation, forms a methodology.

## The Main Phases of a Project Lifecycle

The project lifecycle includes several key phases, each designed to effectively move the project from inception to completion within the organizational context.

### Establishment Phase

The initial phase focuses on preparing to execute the project successfully.

- Objectives agreement, concept definition, and feasibility studies (both technical and economic).
- Business case development, tendering, contract negotiation.
- Setting up processes, metrics, methodologies, and the project team.
- Project environment setup and execution planning.
- Securing project budget and necessary approvals.

### Execution Phase

This phase is centered on delivering the project objectives.

- Architecture and design, detailed planning.
- Construction, testing, assembly, and integration.
- Implementation, commissioning, staff training, and organizational change management.

### Completion Phase

The final phase involves concluding the project and ensuring all aspects are properly closed and documented.

- Conducting post-implementation reviews and documenting lessons learned.
- Contract closure, operational handover, and project team transition.
- Harvesting of intellectual property and administrative closure.

## Project Success and Failure

### Defining Project Success

Project success has evolved beyond the traditional metrics. It now encompasses several dimensions:

- **The Iron Triangle:**
  - Cost (Budget)
  - Time (Schedule)
  - Quality (Performance)
- **Customer Satisfaction:** Meeting the needs and enhancing the overall experience of the customer.
- **Value and Benefits:**
  - Metrics like ROI, market share, stock price, customer retention, and repeat business.
  - Impact on the organization and its ability to manage change.
- **Future Preparedness:** Emphasizing innovation, organizational learning, and adaptability as measures of success.

### Factors Affecting Project Success and Failure

Success and failure of a project are influenced by multiple factors categorized into critical success factors.

| **Resources**            | - Adequate budget <br> - Appropriately skilled and sized project team <br> - Availability of appropriate physical infrastructure, tools and equipment <br> - Access to required knowledge |
| **People and Environment** | - Committed and engaged stakeholders <br> - Continuity of organisational commitment <br> - Appropriate project structure <br> - Appropriate processes and methodologies <br> - Supportive organisational culture <br> - Motivated and empowered project team <br> - Team culture encompassing shared values and a suitable reward system <br> - An atmosphere of mutual respect and trust |

## Building a Business Case

The purpose of a Business Case is to provide a foundation for investment decisions, documenting the viability, desirability, and achievability of a project or program.

### Elements of a Business Case

- **Motivation for Investment:**
  - Market forces, financial constraints, regulatory requirements.
  - Opportunities such as expansion, consolidation, and partnerships.
  - Corporate responsibility, such as sustainability and environmental protection.
- **Objectives:** Defined as SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Time-bound).
  - Examples include increasing revenue, enhancing innovation, and defining clear quantitative targets.
- **Investment Options and Expected Benefits:** Different scenarios and their potential outcomes.
- **Timescale and Cost Estimates:** Detailed timelines and financial requirements.
- **Investment Evaluation and Recommendation:** Analysis and guidance for decision-making.
- **Key Risks:** Identification and mitigation strategies.

### Investment Options

- **Do nothing:** The “status quo” – helps examine the impact of not going ahead with the investment.
- **Do the acceptable minimum:** Risk averse approach – minimize cost and risk.
- **Maximize value under uncertainty:**
  - Asset-related (e.g., replacement vs. upgrade).
  - Scale and scope-related.
  - Timing-related (e.g., immediate vs. delayed investment; window of opportunity).
  - Delivery-related (e.g., “big bang” vs staged delivery).
  - Procurement-related (e.g., make vs buy; contract types).
### Real Options Valuation – The Next Frontier

- Uncertainty changes with time – today’s information may paint an overly pessimistic picture.
- What if we could delay investment until there was less uncertainty?
- Real Options Valuation allows us to assign a value to such an option and use it to inform the investment decisions.
### Types of Real Options

- **Simple options:**
  - Defer the investment.
  - Expand the scope of investment.
  - Scale back the investment.
  - Abandon the investment.
- **Compound options:**
  - Option to stage where the value of the option to start the preceding stage depends on the value of the option to execute the next stage.
  - Parallel options where two or more options are active at the same time.
