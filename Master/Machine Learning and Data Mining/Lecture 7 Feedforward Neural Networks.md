### Deep learning

Deep learning is an approach to machine learning that is inspired by how the human brain operates • It refers to modern artificial Neural Networks (NNs) and emphasizes that these networks are deeper - have more layers than the previous networks. This depth enables them to learn more complex input-output mappings.

Neural Network
Neural networks consist of neurons (units, nodes) that connected with each other with directed links where each connection has an associated numerical weight • The neurons are typically organized into layers • Input layer, output layer and 1 or more hidden layers • During training, the weights are adjusted, in order to learn to perform a certain task (e.g. to predict the correct class)
