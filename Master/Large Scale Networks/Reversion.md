**embedding**

**Structural balance property (SBP)**: For every set of three nodes, if we consider the three edges connecting them, either all three of these edges are labeled + or exactly one of them is labeled +.

Homophily Test: If the fraction of cross-gender edges is significantly less than 2pq, then there is evidence for homophily

Mechanisms underlying homophily 
	Selection: the tendency of people to form friendship with people with similar characteristics – Individual characteristics drive the formation of links 
	Social influence: the tendency of people to change their behavior to be more closely into alignment with the behavior of their friends

Social influence can be considered as the reverse of selection

Community structure: a cohesive group of nodes that are connected “more densely” to each other, than to nodes outside this community

Q(G,S)=2m1​∑S∈S​∑i∈S​∑j∈S​(Aij​−2mdi​dj​​)
Q(G,S)=∑S∈S​(mmS​​−(2mdS​​)2)
The betweenness of an edge is the total amount of flow it carries

▶ The betweenness of edge (a, b) is B(a, b) = P i
