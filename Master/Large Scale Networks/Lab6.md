These are not correct equilibrium values for the Basic PageRank Update Rule. To form an equilibrium set of PageRank values, the summation of these values should equal to 1 and when we apply the Basic PageRank Update Rule, we get the same value back. Node C receives 0.075 from A but gives out 0.10. Node D receives 0.25 but gives out 0.20. Node E receives 0.075 from B but gives out 0.10.
