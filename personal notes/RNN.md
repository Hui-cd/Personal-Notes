为什么RNN是特殊的
和其他 Vanilla Neural Networks（and CNN）不同，这些网络的input and output的size是固定的,计算步骤是固定的
重点是它允许我们对向量序列进行操作

  the sequence regime of operation is much more powerful compared to fixed networks that are doomed from the get-go by a fixed number of computational steps, and hence also much more appealing for those of us who aspire to build more intelligent systems.
